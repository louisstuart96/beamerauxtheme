## Outer Theme

### split with mini frames

This theme inherits primitive `split` outer theme, with additional slide entries after each subsection entry.

### sidebar with mini frames

This theme inherits primitive `sidebar` outer theme, with additional slide entries.

## Inner Theme

### Simple lines

This theme redefines `title page`, `part page`, `section page` and three types of blocks. In particular, blocks are typeset as a whole color box, with a horizontal separation bar between `block title` and `block body`.

**Note**: This theme might be incompatible with color themes that simply reverse foreground and background colors of titles, including `seahorse`, `orchid` and `whale`.
